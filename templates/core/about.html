    About
  </h1>
  <p>
    This site was created by Jordan Silva, Keoni Burns, and Travis Kroll. We wanted to organize all our school work in a
    single place.
    We learned everything needed for this website in Web Development at Chico State.

    our program is a basic scheduler that allows the user to add tasks ssuch as hw, meetings, etc. Additionally we have
    implemented a blog post
    where students may look for study groups.
