# 465FinalProject

Our project consists of a homework scheduler that builds a schedule ordered by date on their upcoming deadlines. It takes a user's input for the classes and their homework which is ordered by date and uses the class id to organize what class they have homework due for. The idea behind this is to then build a schedule based on their enrolled classes and what times they will be free and dedicated homework times. The purpose is to help increase efficiency and allow the user to become more organized so they can do stuff during their free time. 

Home page - shows a brief description from each page
Table showing the homework done 
Classes page - has a add/delete/edit, shows all added classes in a list
Homework page - has a add/delete/edit, shows all homework assignments ordered by date or class id
Calendar - shows a calendar with the class schedule plan on implementing it in similar to pie chart
Looking for group page which is connected to all the users
We plan on making a social page that connects all users on the page and allows people to make comments on other peoples forum posts. This feature is to connect everyone on our site if they need help. Furthermore the user that made the post is the one who can delete it or an admin. Also its used to just chat about the homework that is assigned.
